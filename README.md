Automatic code comment generation with ChatGPT and AIPRM.

**Note :** You need the `AIPRM for ChatGPT` extension on your browser.
  
## How it works: 
Copy-paste the code you want to comment on. You receive as output the commented code in markdown code format. ChatGPT tells you what the code does, which can be useful for writing documentation, but can also waste your time. I'm trying to find a way to only output the commented code.
